But if your agents do a lot of work *outside* of Zendesk, the tickets they're viewing will be sent to another agent automatically.\nFor companies and teams with sophisticated workflows this can lead to tickets being sent to multiple agents at a time.\n\nThis app solves that problem by assigning the ticket directly to the agent on view. No more duplication of effort!\nSimply set which Ticket Groups should be auto-assigned and the app will do the rest. As soon as an agent in that group(s) views a ticket from that group(s), it will assign to them.\n\nThis unobtrusive application will sit in the ticket sidebar and display the result of its \"decision\" (to assign, or not and why).\n\nIf you like this app, but it is missing a feature critical to your workflow: [Let us know!](https://support.3sigmatechnologies.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=13806449792525)",
