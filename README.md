# Name
Auto-Assigner

# Short Description
Assigns tickets to viewing user if ticket and user have same group.

# Long Description
Zendesk's Guided Mode is a fantastic means of delivering work to agents. But if your agents do a lot of work *outside* of Zendesk, the tickets they're viewing will be sent to another agent automatically.
For companies and teams with sophisticated workflows this can lead to tickets being sent to multiple agents at a time.

This app solves that problem by assigning the ticket directly to the agent on view. No more duplication of effort!
Simply set which Ticket Groups should be auto-assigned and the app will do the rest. As soon as an agent in that group views a ticket from that group, it will assign to them.
