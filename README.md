# Name
Auto-Assigner

# Short Description
Assigns ticket to viewing user if ticket and user have same group.

# Long Description
Zendesk's Guided Mode is a fantastic means of delivering work to agents. But if your agents do a lot of work *outside* of Zendesk, the tickets they're viewing will be sent to another agent automatically.
For companies and teams with sophisticated workflows this can lead to tickets being sent to multiple agents at a time.

This app solves that problem by assigning the ticket directly to the agent on view. No more duplication of effort!
Simply set which Ticket Groups should be auto-assigned and the app will do the rest. As soon as an agent in that group(s) views a ticket from that group(s), it will assign to them.

This unobtrusive application will sit in the ticket sidebar and display the result of its "decision" (to assign, or not and why). Please review the installation instructions for a list of available configuration options.

# Installation Instructions
**Note**: You need administrator permissions in Zendesk to set up the app.
 * Click the Install button above on this page.
 * Set up the app configuration according to your needs (see below for configurable parameters).
 * That's it! You're ready to start saving clicks.

## Configuration Options

<!-- groups -->
* **Auto-Assign Groups**: Comma-separated list of group names and/or ids that will auto-assign a ticket when viewed by an agent.
<!-- runonall -->
* **Auto-Assign all groups**: If true, the app will run on all tickets. Use the below role/group restrictions to control which users are effected. (This setting will prevent 'Match all user groups' from working properly and will ignore the setting above.)
<!-- matchall -->
* **Match all user groups**: If true, tickets will only auto-assign if all of the user's groups are in Auto-Assign Groups above. (Useful to avoid assigning tickets to non-agent users such as QA or Training.)
<!-- exactmatch -->
* **Match user groups exactly**: If true, tickets will only auto-assign if the ticket group matches the user's one and only group. (This is helpful if you're installing the app for one user group.)
<!-- tagstoadd -->
* **Tags**: Set this to a non-blank value to apply tags to each ticket when auto-assigned. Enter multiple tags as comma separated list.
